            <img src="images/environment-and-ecology-upsc.jpg">
            <p>Sustainable living is achieved by making choices that aim to reduce our individual and collective environmental
                 impact by making positive changes to offset climate change and reduce environmental damage. 
                 It is a way to reduce our carbon footprint and better use the Earth’s resources to minimize the environmental damage that can be caused by our 
                 lifestyle choices.
                Sustainability means making choices today that will positively impact the planet tomorrow.
                 It means thinking of the needs of future generations by ensuring that they will inherit a safe and healthy planet to live and thrive on.</p>

            <h2 class="center">SUSTAINABLE LIVING VS ZERO WASTE---WHAT'S THE DIFFRENCE?</h2>
            <img src="images/zero-waste-vs-low-impact-featured-1024x683.jpg">
            <p>Sustainable living and the zero-waste movement have similar goals and many similar lifestyle patterns, but are a little bit different. 
                Those trying to live sustainably aim to lower their overall environmental impact in a variety of ways, while the primary focus of those living zero waste is 
                typically to reduce the amount of trash they produce, namely single-use plastic.
                For example, someone whose primary goal is to live zero waste and produce zero trash
                 may be comfortable eating meat that was purchased without any plastic. But someone aiming to live a well-rounded, 
                 sustainable lifestyle may consider the bigger picture (aka the massive environmental impact and ethical concerns of animal agriculture) and 
                 opt for a plant-based meal instead, even if it is packaged in plastic.</p>

            <h2 class="center">IMPACT OF SUSTAINABLE LIVING?</h2>
            <img src="images/recycling-paper-and-plastics-1024x683.jpg">
            <p>The average American produces 4.9 pounds of trash per day, according to the EPA — that comes out to around 1,788 pounds per year. 
                So by transitioning to a zero-waste lifestyle, you could literally save thousands of pounds of trash from going to landfills,
                 where it would emit harmful greenhouse gases.
                By eating a vegan or plant-based diet, every year, you can save: 401,500 gallons of water, 14,600 pounds of grain; 10,950 square
                 feet of forest, 7,300 pounds of CO2, and 365 animal lives, according to the Vegan Calculator.
                While it may seem like small changes such as going zero-waste or vegan won’t really make a difference, looking at those statistics 
                make it clear that sustainability lifestyle changes can be powerful.</p>

            <h2 class="center">WHAT PEOPLE CAN DO?</h2>
            <img src="images/images.jpg">
            <p>Eat a plant-based diet.
                Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact foods on Earth. To lower your diet’s footprint, 
                consider transitioning to a vegan diet, or at least eating more vegan meals. Along with this, it’s important to focus on wasting less food,
                 buying locally-produced food, and composting.
                Compost your food scarps.
                Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like vegetable peels, avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill, start composting. 
                Composting is the process of returning anything that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade into soil. Setting up a compost bin is super easy 
                if you have a backyard, but it’s also possible if you live in an apartment or in a city with no yard
                Reduce your single-use plastic use.
                Take a page out of the zero-waste lifestyle, and have a look through your trash to get started. 
                Whatever items are clogging your garbage can, research plastic-free alternatives that you can buy instead.Take advantage of your local bulk bins,
                 and when you run out of something (whether it’s a food item, a personal hygiene product, or disposable items such as napkins or paper towels),
                  look for reusable or sustainable alternatives.</p>
